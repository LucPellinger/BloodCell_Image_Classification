# =========== Gradio App Launcher ===========
# This script launches the Gradio app with different tabs for various functionalities.
# The app is structured to allow for easy addition of new tabs in the future.
# The main function `launch_app` initializes the app and sets up the tabs.
# The app is designed to be modular, with each page being defined in its own module.
# Each page module should define a function that sets up the UI components for that page.
# The app is launched using the `launch_app` function, which is called when the script is run directly.

# =========== Setting the Theme ===========
# to see customize themes run the gradio_theme_builder.py script
# and follow the instructions in the terminal

# =========== Launching the App ===========
# The main function that launches the Gradio app.
# It initializes the app with a theme and sets up the tabs.


# Inject the URI directly into your CSS
